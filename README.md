# RarFS - Fuse extension for mounting rar files

RarFS is a Fuse module for mounting an uncompressed rar archive as a filesystem. This is a good idea for eg. video streaming where the media file is in a rar archive and you don't want to use a lot of extra diskspace, and time, for extracting and then streaming.
